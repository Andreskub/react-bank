# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#
# **Steps**

## 1. Creation of Repository
Select a folder and create a new repository with the following line:
```
$ npx create-react-app app-name
```

## 2. Install Tools
```
$ npm install styled-components --save
```
>help keep the concerns of styling and element architecture separated and make components more readable. Furthermore, when you have components that rely on JavaScript for their style, Styled Components gives control of those states back to CSS instead of using a multitude of conditional class names
```
$ npm install react-router-dom --save
```
>A tool that allows you to handle routes in a web app, using dynamic routing. Dynamic routing takes place as the app is rendering on your machine, unlike the old routing architecture where the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app.

## 3. Run
We run the repository with the following line:
```
$ npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
